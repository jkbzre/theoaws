Through its portrayal of my grandfather, Ato Tekle-tsadik Mekuria –Ethiopia’s most renowned historian – the story bypasses Eurocentric concepts of Ethiopian history by exploring ideas of origins and the nature of identity. The story continually shifts back in time, moving seamlessly from the present day to Ethiopia’s colonial past, from its creation myth to the paleoanthropological period in which the first human being, Lucy, was discovered. It manages to do this with a light-hearted and humorous approach that is both sympathetic and compassionate while also recognising the more serious problems facing present-day Ethiopia against the backdrop of its rich cultural heritage.  ", text2:"The film is both the story of a filmmaker engaging with a historian to create a portrait of a country and a grandson’s journey of self-discovery through stories told by his grandfather."},

Kemp is portrayed here through a dreamlike video montage, in which any clear distinctions between reality and fiction, truth and illusion, are subverted, and where electronically manipulated images mix with real-life footage to evoke Kemp’s imaginary and metamorphic universe.", text2: "The video is composed of a wealth of material from multiple sources and took almost a year to edit. It includes interviews with Kemp, his mother and his closest long-time collaborators; improvised performances by Kemp at home and in television studios; Kemp in the dressing room, at rehearsals and teaching; and selections from Kemp’s performances including the premiere of Onnagata. It also includes archival footage and contextual material such as Kemp’s early dance recordings, which provide insight into the eclectic influences informing Kemp’s art and its cultural context. Travelling Light received its first prize at the 1993 Berlin Video Festival." },

Partly an homage to Federico Fellini, the film cuts restlessly between the intimate and the monumental, silence and noise, the banal and the baroque, as different fragments of “being” ebb into this almost inhumanly overwhelming paradox. The sensuality of the body is a recurring motif: its sexuality, movement and discrepancies working in tandem with the idealised form of ancient Roman power. An epigraph – in which Carl Gustav Jung reveals his fear of visiting the city – strikes a note of neurotic unpredictability. But this is overlaid by a vision of the city as i/Wunderkammer, an impression mirrored in the eyes of its visitors (or the viewers of this film), as they are induced to marvel, and at times smile, at the absurdity of the range and grandeur of its image.", text2: "The narrative structure takes its cue from a short novel by Ben Okri, i/Astonishing i/the i/Gods (1995), in which the main character – presumed to be African – goes to an imaginary place, assumed here to be a European capital. i/ROMA is the vision of this fictitious character as he marvels at what he sees. Here we have the starting point: a vision of the city in which the sacred and profane enter into a dialogue with the ephemeral and eternal to reveal a city full of the ghosts of its imperial past. With images gathered over a decade, this non-narrative film, presented in the form of a triptych, conveys the impact that the marvels of this city would have on the eyes of an imagined foreigner. Its delirious vision of splendour and rootlessness is juxtaposed by a soundtrack of field recordings from the streets of Rome, made by renowned contemporary composer Alvin Curran.", text3: `Many writers and travellers have attempted to pinpoint the character of Rome and have often fallen prey to its romantic allure. A place greater than any imagination and eternally indifferent to any reading of it, the thought that you can walk in the footsteps of Julius Caesar, sit on a stone where Michelangelo sat, or have a date under the balcony balcony where Mussolini addressed the masses – all within the space of a fewhundred metres – is truly overwhelming. It is a city of contradictions where theopposite of every assertion is also true; a place of great warmth and beauty that canalso reveal total indifference and detachment, characterized by a natural and oftencomical vulgarity. It can be loved and hated in the same breath.`, text4: `i/ROMA portrays this through the enchanted eyes of an unidentified foreigner who comes to visit the city, bringing with him his diversity, art and culture, only to find them absorbed into the city’s fabric.` },

The Cold War was undermined by a paradoxical threat of world destruction: the development of nuclear power was a scientific breakthrough capable of enhancing many aspects of human life but its chief development as a weapon of mass destruction made it an epoch-changing invention that questioned the very sanity of the human mind.

Presented throughout the 80s as a self-standing piece, debate and controversy was rife during its run. More than anything else, i/Questa i/è i/Vita is a coming-out video in which the full poetic power of video art as a form of expression is forcefully asserted.", questa1:"“C‘est la vie... I deliberately borrow an inaccurate translation of the Italian saying used by the author. A more faithful translation would be ‘ceci est la vie’, involving an assertion without a undertone. An unchanging principle. But the French expression ‘c’est la vie’ echoes a certain sense  fatality. A resigned acceptance of destiny. But in both cases, life, whatever it may be, must sti triumph, again and again. This is the epiphany and message from this grand finale ending – an invitati to resilience to use a word taken from philosophy and psychology books. Ceci est la vie and it inscrib itself in the flesh, in the senses and in an unalterable impulse. The heartbeat, highlighted by A Blakey’s percussion, the revelation of the soul similar to the music we call soul. But it is al the establishing of a pantheon of heroes who gave their heart and soul to serve a belief. All of them – ev James Brown, whose presence might seem anecdotal but who sang “Say it loud, I’m black and proud at the top of the struggle against segregation in 60s United States. Otis Redding is also invite whose hoarse voice demands ‘respect’. Also present is the elegance of David Bowie, master of a sorts of disguise and Janus of multiple faces.", questa2:"i/Questa i/è i/Vita is a chorus, an anthem for beastly love, for absolute love, lived through what we carry in the small of our back. It is a bacchanal in which couples dance and where nothing metaphorical remains. We are in the middle of a catharsis. This Dionysian universe. A swinging finale where all impulses are set free. No prohibition anymore, no tomorrow anymore. It’s all about the moment. C’est la vie. This uncontrolled and uncontrollable explosion which, in our times of restriction, recalls the happiness of being. To live happily and die young. Being yourself, whatever it takes, as Muhammad Ali, The Greatest, once suggested. Tomorrow is abolished. Tomorrow might never come. But behind this frenzy to live, death is lurking. All the figures Theo Eshetu calls to the witness stand are gone. Only our memories of them remain. Perhaps this is the magic of this passing life. It remains the memory of the loved ones, of those who made something of their life and went beyond the simple happiness of being, to carry out a struggle - Jimi Hendrix and his guitar, whose riffs still echo in our ears. A metaphor of life can have a boxing ring, a stage on which it is played out, a show whose outline remains blurred."},

The work expresses itself through sounds and images that cannot be communicated with words. i/Body i/and i/Soul i/V3 is therefore an expression of the nature of communication and video itself, paradoxically showing the capacity of the medium to form thoughts, feelings and opinions, even when no discernible narrative is present.", text4:"The V3 in the title refers to a hypothetical third phase in the Body and Soul (or Mind and Matter) debate, proposing that the mediated presence of bodies on monitors and TV screens distort our perception of reality by creating the illusion of a physical presence that is not actually there.

It is by echoing Pasolini’s writings that Eshetu speaks of i/Africanized: ‘Our so-called freedom has never been so narrow. We are free to think what we want, but we have to build our ideas on lies we are told.’ At a time when we are inundated with information – deluded into thinking we know far too much (and in real time) about the reality of events in any part of the world – we begin to suspect that such a vast amount of information serves only to cover up the gaps and silences on so many necessary, vital issues about which we are left in the dark. Among such vital questions, the relationship with other cultures is perhaps most necessary. There is no doubt, according to Theo, that digital technology – and the information disseminated through it – can be a new, modern form of colonisation.

Appropriating Picasso’s iconic cornerstone of Western modernism acts as a point of departure, whereby images from African sources (as well as other modernist sources that informed the creation of the work) are inserted directly over the painting. In doing so, viewers are invited to consider the construction and dissolution of cultural tropes throughout the history of Western art.", text2:"Through projections, a combination of African and modernist sources are layered onto live performers that re-enact the narratives found in the painting. As the title suggests, we say “adieu” to “Les Demoiselles”, and instead encounter performers for whom sexuality is both more nuanced and empowered than the prostitutes of Picasso’s i/demoiselles." },

M. W. Turner’s painting i/Slavers i/Throwing i/Overboard i/the i/Dead i/and i/Dying, i/Typhoon i/Coming i/On functions as a point of departure. Turner’s painting represents the slave ship Zong, an emblem of the horrors of slavery after its captain threw 133 enslaved Africans overboard to drown as a means to claim insurance for financial loss.", text3:"While Turner’s painting imagines the enslaved being lost forever to the ocean’s depths, i/The i/Slave i/Ship evokes a history of the Middle Passage to redeem those victims of the slave trade. In this installation, a semi-circular projection finds its reflection in a large mirror, creating a luminous orb redolent of the sea captain’s telescope and the cartographer’s chart. Within it unfolds scenes of ocean life and mysterious underwater landscapes along with images of the enslaved and of human suffering, juxtaposed with scenes of wharves and warehouses in Hamburg – a city that traded in both sugar and slaves. The implication is that Hamburg’s commercial waters, like those of all slaving cities, are now haunted by the ghosts of the drowned, returned to meet the present. The film’s soundtrack combines Buddhist chants with a grand baroque lamentation chorus from J. S. Bach’s i/St. i/Matthew i/Passion, creating a contrast of phonic cultures to reflect the tragedy and poetics of human suffering."},

According to several systems of thought, an intrinsic connection between all living beings relates to the world in much the same way as the soul is connected to the human body. This theme of Body and Soul, as mediated through a reflection on the televised image, is illustrated with footage and captured images of early experiments: a cathode-ray tube, rituals and dances from diverse cultures, x- rays and animated statues.

Her almost static pose, combined with the fact that she is neither an actress nor a performer, gives her movements a spontaneous and natural rhythm. Multiplying and mirroring the image underlines the patterns of her silhouette, which is reminiscent of the designs and ornaments found in Islamic art. In so doing, she loses clear-cut recognisability as a human in form, becoming instead a symmetrical sign in continuous mutation.
